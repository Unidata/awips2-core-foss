The camel-core-2.14.1.jar has been modified.

The
org/apache/camel/com/googlecode/concurrentlinkedhashmap/  has been replaced with the one from camel 2.15

Camel includes concurrentlinkedhashmap not as a normal dependency but instead grabs it at build time with maven and renames it. So it's part of the Camel core and Camel will not use an external upgraded version.

Replacing concurrentlinkedhashmap in Camel this way provides a lower risk method of upgrading than by upgrading the entirety of Camel.
